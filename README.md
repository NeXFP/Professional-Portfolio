## Welcome to my Professional Portfolio


## Header 
    For my portfolio, I decided to use a flex box to center out my navigation menu at the top of the page. 
    If you click on each individual portion of the navigation menu, 
    it will properly direct you to each individual section on the webpage. 
    Here I also added text shadows with extended blur so that the navigation menu stands out at the top of the webpage.

## About Me
    For my about me, I included a photo of a logo I have from when I do graphic design in several forums. 
    In this portion of the webpage, I introduce myself, including hobbies, what I do for work and the feeling I try to get across for this webpage.
    I also included that if you click on the logo, it would also take you to my deviantart portfolio via a new tab. 
    This was primarily just something to include for the fun of it.

## Resume 
    For this section, I included an embedded pdf of an actual resume I created. 
    It works by simply scrolling up and down like you would a normal webpage. 
    This was mainly used for a placeholder for when I actually include an updated resume.

## Works 
    For my works section, I've included two separate examples, one being a placeholder in which nothing will occur when you either click on it or hover over it. 
    The second one, when clicked on, it should take you to a webpage known as Horiseon in a new tab. 
    This is something I worked on during the 1st challenge of Week 1 in the Coding Bootcamp and I used this so that the works section wasn't just a placeholder section.

## Footer 
    In my footer is essentially my contact me section. 
    Included are three different icons. By clicking on each one, it directs you to a place where I can be contacted. 
    The mail button should open up a popup asking to open up the Mail application on your pc. 
    The linkedin icon will pull open a new tab with my LinkedIn profile open. 
    The github icon will take you to my github profile in a new tab.

## Summary 
    To summarize, majority of this is mainly a placeholder as a lot of the things on the website will be touched up on the later down the line during this bootcamp but I created this with the idea of being different from others. 
    I chose pastel colors to catch the eye and not be too straining on the eye as I wanted the readability of the webpage to be easy. 
    This also includes a slightly darker pastel gradient map in the background so that the sections pop out slightly more to the people looking at it.
